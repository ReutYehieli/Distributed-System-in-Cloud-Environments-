# Distributed-System-in-Cloud-Environments-
Developed a distributed system that processes a list of text files, analyzes them in various levels, upload the analyzed text to S3, and generates an output HTML file. The system is composed of a local application and multiple services running on EC2 instances. Synchronization between the master server and the workers is achieved via SQS.
